## **1. Introduction to AI and Machine Learning**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines. Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, enables systems to improve performance from experience without explicit programming.

* **Narrow AI:** Specialized tasks (e.g., image classification).
* **General AI:** Hypothetical AI capable of human-like reasoning.

## **2. What is Generative AI?**

Generative AI refers to AI systems that can produce new, original content by learning from large datasets.

* **Discriminative vs Generative:**

  * *Discriminative* models classify or predict outcomes.
  * *Generative* models create new data resembling the training data.
* Examples: ChatGPT (text), DALL·E (images), MusicLM (music).

## **3. Types of Generative AI Models**

**3.1 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**

* Two components: Generator and Discriminator in a competitive setup.
* Applications: Deepfake generation, super-resolution.

**3.2 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**

* Encoder-decoder structure for probabilistic data generation.
* Applications: Image interpolation, anomaly detection.

**3.3 Diffusion Models**

* Gradually add noise to data, then learn to reverse the process.
* Applications: High-quality image generation (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

## **4. Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)**

LLMs are AI systems trained on massive text corpora to understand and generate human-like text.

* Examples: GPT-3, GPT-4, PaLM, LLaMA.
* Core abilities: Summarization, translation, reasoning, Q\&A.

## **5. Architecture of LLMs**

The **transformer architecture** is the backbone of modern LLMs.

**Key Components:**

* **Embedding Layer**: Converts words/tokens into vectors.
* **Positional Encoding**: Adds sequence order information.
* **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Determines importance of each word in relation to others.
* **Feed-Forward Layers**: Non-linear transformation of representations.
* **Residual Connections & Layer Normalization**: Stabilize training.

## **6. Training Process and Data Requirements**

* **Data Size:** Billions of tokens from diverse sources.
* **Pretraining:** Predict next token given context.
* **Fine-tuning:** Specialization for specific tasks.
* **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF):** Aligns outputs with human values.

## **7. Scaling Effects in LLMs**

Scaling laws show that increasing parameters, dataset size, and compute power leads to improved performance—up to a point.

* GPT-3: 175B parameters
* GPT-4: Estimated \~1T parameters
  **Impact:** Better generalization, few-shot learning, richer context understanding.

## **9. Limitations and Ethical Considerations**

* Bias in training data
* Misinformation generation (deepfakes, fake news)
* Intellectual property concerns
* Environmental impact of large-scale training
